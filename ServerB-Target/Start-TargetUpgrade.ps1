<#
.SYNOPSIS
    TARGET EXECUTION SCRIPT - runs ON Server B (the server being upgraded).
    Performs mandatory safety pre-checks, backs up critical state, mounts the
    upgrade ISO (or reuses an already-mounted one), and launches Windows Setup
    in unattended in-place-upgrade mode. Registers scheduled tasks so progress
    can keep being tracked across the multiple reboots that follow.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script is normally copied to Server B and invoked remotely by
    Start-RemoteUpgradeOrchestrator.ps1 (running on Server A), but it is fully
    self-contained and can also be run interactively/locally on Server B for
    testing.

    Flow:
      1. Bootstrap folders + logging.
      2. Hard-fail pre-checks (Section 1 of the spec). ANY failure here stops
         the script immediately - nothing below runs.
      3. Non-blocking checks (patch level / VMware Tools / RDS CAL) - these can
         warn-and-terminate (patch level, unless -SkipPatchCheckLab is used) or
         warn-only (RDS CAL pointer) per the customer's exact ask.
      4. Backup of registry hives, local GPO/SECPOL, and (if applicable) the
         RDS CAL licensing database to a folder on a drive OTHER than C:.
      5. Locate/mount the upgrade ISO and locate setup.exe.
      6. Launch setup.exe unattended, register the phase/progress monitor,
         the reboot-event watcher, and the retention-based auto-cleanup task.

.NOTES
    Author       : Generated for OS Upgrade Automation ()
    Requires     : Windows Server 2019/2022, PowerShell 5.1+, run elevated (SYSTEM
                   or local Administrator) on Server B.
    Shared paths : Must stay in sync with Update-UpgradeStatus.ps1 and
                   Remove-UpgradeArtifacts.ps1 (registry root, base dir, JSON path,
                   scheduled task names).

.PARAMETER IsoFolder
    Folder on Server B containing the target OS ISO. Default: D:\ISO
    If exactly one .iso file exists there, it is used automatically.

.PARAMETER MinFreeSpaceGB
    Minimum required free space on the system drive (C:) before proceeding.
    Default: 32 GB (per spec; configurable).

.PARAMETER BackupRoot
    Root folder for the state/policy backup. MUST be on a drive other than C:.
    Default: D:\UpgradeBackup

.PARAMETER StatusJsonPath
    Path to the JSON status file that Server A reads directly (e.g. via the
    D$ admin share) when WinRM/CIM is unavailable during reboots.
    Default: D:\upgrade_status.json

.PARAMETER RetentionDays
    Days to retain the registry status key + JSON file + ProgramData artifacts
    after the upgrade reaches a terminal state, before automatic cleanup fires.
    Default: 14.

.PARAMETER DisableAutoCleanup
    Skip registering the auto-cleanup scheduled task; cleanup then becomes a
    manual/on-demand action via Remove-UpgradeArtifacts.ps1 -Force.

.PARAMETER SkipPatchCheckLab
    LAB/TEST-ONLY OVERRIDE. When the patch-level check finds the server is not
    current, normal behavior is to log a warning AND terminate. Pass this
    switch to downgrade that to a warning-only (proceed anyway) - intended
    strictly for lab/non-production validation runs, never production.

.PARAMETER SkipDismScanHealthLab
    LAB/TEST-ONLY PERFORMANCE OVERRIDE. Skip the read-only
    `Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth` pre-check and record that check
    as WARN. This leaves component-store health unverified and must never be
    used for production acceptance or rollout.

.PARAMETER SkipSfcScanNowLab
    LAB/TEST-ONLY PERFORMANCE OVERRIDE. Skip `sfc /scannow` and its
    supplementary CBS.log analysis, recording that check as WARN. This leaves
    protected Windows system-file integrity unverified and must never be used
    for production acceptance or rollout.

.PARAMETER SkipSystemStateBackup
    Skip backup task 8 of 8 (the wbadmin system state backup). That task is
    by far the slowest and largest part of the backup stage, so skipping it
    is useful for repeat lab runs, or where an external/enterprise backup
    product (or a VM snapshot) already provides an equivalent restore point.
    Everything else in the backup stage still runs: registry hives, GPO,
    secedit, gpresult, RDS CAL DB, and the pre-upgrade services snapshot.
    Think carefully before using this in production - system state is the
    artifact you would need for a bare-metal/AD-level restore if the upgrade
    goes badly.

.PARAMETER MinVMwareToolsVersion
    Minimum acceptable VMware Tools version when Server B is a VMware VM.
    Default: "12.0.0". Ignored entirely on Hyper-V/physical hardware.

.PARAMETER UseControlledReboot
    When set, setup.exe is launched with /NoReboot and this script explicitly
    triggers the first restart after a short grace delay, giving you a
    controlled maintenance-window reboot instead of letting Setup reboot
    immediately on its own schedule. Default: off (Setup manages its own
    reboots end-to-end, which is the simpler/most common pattern).

.PARAMETER PrecheckOnly
    Run pre-checks only. Do not perform state backup, register scheduled
    tasks, or launch setup.exe. Useful for fast assessment verification.

.EXAMPLE
    Local/manual test run on Server B:
    powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\Start-TargetUpgrade.ps1" -IsoFolder "D:\ISO"

.EXAMPLE
    Lab run bypassing only the patch-currency hard stop:
    powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\Start-TargetUpgrade.ps1" -SkipPatchCheckLab

.EXAMPLE
    Faster disposable-lab run, skipping DISM, SFC, and system state backup:
    powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\Start-TargetUpgrade.ps1" -SkipDismScanHealthLab -SkipSfcScanNowLab -SkipSystemStateBackup

    Enables SeBackupPrivilege + SeRestorePrivilege on THIS process's token.
    Local Administrators are GRANTED these privileges by Windows, but they
    sit DISABLED by default until a process explicitly turns them on via
    AdjustTokenPrivileges - this is exactly why 'reg.exe export HKLM\SAM' and
    especially 'HKLM\SECURITY' normally fail with Access Denied even when
    running as a local admin: HKLM\SECURITY's ACL denies read access to
    everyone except SYSTEM/TrustedInstaller, but SeBackupPrivilege (once
    enabled) makes Windows bypass that ACL check specifically for backup-
    style operations such as RegSaveKeyEx, which is what 'reg.exe export'
    uses under the hood - no need to actually be SYSTEM.
    Child processes (like reg.exe) spawned AFTER this runs inherit the
    enabled privilege state via their duplicated token, so this only needs
    to run ONCE per session, before the registry export step below.
    Best-effort / non-fatal: if the current token genuinely doesn't hold the
    privilege (e.g. a constrained/JEA context, or - on an interactive local
    console - a UAC-filtered standard-user token rather than a full admin
    token), this simply returns $false and the existing non-blocking WARN
    already in place for SAM/SECURITY export failures still applies exactly
    as before - this is a pure enhancement, not a required dependency.

# --- RDS Session Host -> CAL license server pointer (warning-only) ------------
# Enhanced 2026-08-26 (customer ask). Per Microsoft's documented RDS CAL
# version-compatibility rules (learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/remote/
# remote-desktop-services/rds-client-access-license): a license server can
# only install/issue CALs for its OWN Windows Server version or an EARLIER
# one - never a later one. So once this session host is upgraded, its
# configured CAL license server(s) must (a) run an OS version >= the TARGET
# OS being upgraded to, AND (b) already have CALs for that target OS version
# installed - otherwise clients lose the ability to obtain a valid RDS CAL
# once the post-upgrade licensing grace period ends. Best-effort remote
# check, bounded by a timeout (same Start-Job/Wait-Job pattern as the WUA
# search above) so an unreachable/firewalled license server can never stall
# this pre-check phase - always WARN, never FAIL, since this is a licensing/
# compliance concern (same category as the OS activation check) and the
# remote query itself may not always be possible (no network path, no WMI/
# DCOM access, etc).
