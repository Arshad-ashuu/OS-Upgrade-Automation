<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Runs on a schedule (every 2 minutes, registered by Start-TargetUpgrade.ps1)
    on Server B. Detects which phase of the in-place upgrade is currently
    active, estimates a progress percentage by parsing Windows Setup's own
    Panther logs / registry, and writes the result to BOTH the registry
    (HKLM:\SOFTWARE\OSUpgradeAutomation) and the JSON status file
    (D:\upgrade_status.json) so Server A can read it either way.

.DESCRIPTION
    Phase model (kept identical to the numbers used by Start-TargetUpgrade.ps1
    and the setupcomplete.cmd / setuprollback.cmd hooks):
        1  Pre-Upgrade Assessment
        2  State & Policy Backup
        3  Downlevel Phase        (still on source build, setup.exe running)
        4  Safe OS Phase          (WinPE - blind window, no script can run)
        5  First Boot Phase       (new build booted, SystemSetupInProgress=1)
        6  Second Boot (OOBE) Phase (setupcomplete.cmd /PostOOBE fired)
        7  Post-Upgrade Validation / Completed
        99 Rolled Back / Failed   (setuprollback.cmd /PostRollback fired)

    HONEST LIMITATION (Safe OS / Phase 4): the machine boots into a temporary
    WinPE-like environment to apply the new image. No script or scheduled task
    can execute there. The event-triggered 'OSUpgradeRebootWatcher' task marks
    Phase 4 the instant a restart is initiated (Event ID 1074); after that,
    LastUpdated simply stops advancing until First Boot - this is the same
    heuristic SCCM/MDT-style dashboards use.

    Polls, hooks and -RebootEvent calls share mutexes with the starter and
    artifact cleanup (starter lock first, status lock second).
    Terminal registry state is retained if JSON publication fails, and the
    monitor retries publication before unregistering itself. A missing or
    mismatched target build fails validation; activation and service health
    findings on a verified target build produce CompletedWithWarnings.
    Successful transitions require PostUpgradeBuild, PostUpgradeValidationTime
    (UTC), and PostUpgradeValidationResult (Passed or PassedWithWarnings);
    these fields are written to both registry and JSON before completion.

.PARAMETER RebootEvent
    Called by the Event ID 1074 watcher. Marks an inferred Safe OS transition
    only while the run is InProgress in Downlevel/Safe OS, never after boot
    progression or terminal completion.

# because that comparison silently breaks when SourceBuild equals
# TargetBuild (e.g. a same-version test upgrade, or any genuine same-build
# refresh install): $currentBuild -eq $sourceBuild is then ALWAYS true, even
# long after the real upgrade finished, permanently trapping execution in
# the "still on old build" branch below (which returns) and never reaching
# the OOBE-marker check that already exists further down for the normal
# (differing-build) case. Section 1b already guarantees this marker is
# removed at the start of every fresh run, so its presence here can only
